# Angular Board Application

This is a simple Angular application that allows you to manage items across multiple columns on a board. Each column can hold a list of numbers, which you can add, edit, delete, reorder within a column, and move between columns.

## Features

- Add a number to any column.
- Edit existing numbers.
- Delete numbers from a column.
- Reorder items within a column using move up and move down buttons.
- Move items between columns using move left and move right buttons.
- Automatic background color based on divisibility:
  - Green: Divisible by 3
  - Blue: Divisible by 5
  - Yellow: Divisible by both 3 and 5
  - Red: None of the above cases

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd angular-board-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```bash
ng serve
```

## Usage

- To add a number, enter a valid number in the "Add a number" input field and click the "Add" button.
- Use the edit (pencil icon), delete (trash can icon), move up/down (arrows), move left (left arrow), and move right (right arrow) buttons to manage items.
- Items will automatically receive a background color based on their divisibility by 3, 5, or both.
